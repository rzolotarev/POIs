## Decisions
    To separate logic of working with different types of points I used discriminatorKey in Mongoose.    
    To run node.js application you should run 'npm start' and mongodb should be running on localhost:27017 by default 
    (I didn't have time to create a docker container)

## Open issues
1. to fill models of cinema, restaurant points;
2. to complete update, create points of interface functionality;
3. to make searching by coordinates using map;
